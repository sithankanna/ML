* Image 
    * Blueprint / Instructions of a Container / Snapshot of container 
    * Made up of layers 
        * Base Layer e.g. Ubuntu, 
        * Software layer
        * Dependency layer 

* Container
    * Running instance of a Docker image 
    * Contains everything you need to run an application 

* VM vs Container 
    * VM has a complete OS. Hardware is virtualised by hypervisor 
    * Container don't have OS

    * Repo for images. Including official images 

Benefits
